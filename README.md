## About This Project

This **Java-based truss analysis software** calculates internal forces such as **axial forces, tension, and compression** in 2D truss members. The app features an intuitive **Swing GUI** where users can input **node coordinates**, **member connections**, **support conditions** (including pin and roller supports), and **applied loads** in both X and Y directions.

It then **automatically computes reaction forces and member forces** using **equilibrium equations** solved by a custom-built solver with **Gaussian elimination**. The results are visualized with **color-coded truss diagrams**:

- 🔵 Blue indicates **compression** forces (negative)
- 🔴 Red indicates **tension** forces (positive)

---

## Features

- GUI for inputting:
  - Node coordinates and member connectivity
  - Support types (pin, roller with x/y constraints)
  - Loads applied at each node (X/Y directions)
- Automatic calculation of:
  - Reaction forces at supports
  - Internal forces of each truss member
- Visual representation of forces in the truss diagram

---

## Tech Stack

- Language: **Java**
- GUI Framework: **Swing**
- Solver: Custom linear equation solver (Gaussian elimination)
